This launches a connection to a published resource. The utility then terminates, leaving a successfully connected session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-E\n, \n--enumerate\n\n\nEnumerates the available resources.\n\n\nBy default, the resource name, display name, and folder of the resource are displayed. Additional information can be displayed, by using the \n--details\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-S\n, \n--subscribed\n\n\nLists the subscribed resources.\n\n\nBy default, the resource name, display name, and folder of the resource are displayed. Additional information can be displayed using the \n--details\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-M\n, \n--details\n Use in conjunction with the \n-E\n or \n-S\n option.\n\n\nSelects which attributes of published applications are returned. This option takes an argument that is the sum of the numbers corresponding to the required details: \nPublisher(0x1)\n, \nVideoType(0x2)\n, \nSoundType(0x4)\n, \nAppInStartMenu(0x8)\n, \nAppOnDesktop(0x10)\n, \nAppIsDesktop(0x20)\n, \nAppIsDisabled(0x40)\n, \nWindowType(0x80)\n, \nWindowScale(0x100)\n, \nDisplayName(0x200)\n, and \nAppIsMandatory(0x10000)\n. \nCreateShortcuts(0x100000)\n can be used in conjunction with \n-S\n, \n-s\n, and \n-u\n to create menu entries for subscribed applications. \nRemoveShortcuts(0x200000)\n can be used with \n-S\n to delete all menu entries.\n\n\nSome of these details are not available through storebrowse. If this is the case, the output is 0. Values can also be expressed in decimal as well as hexadecimal (for example, 512 for 0x200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-v\n, \n--version\n\n\nWrites the version number of \nstorebrowse\n to the standard output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-?\n, \n-h\n, \n--help\n\n\nLists the usage for \nstorebrowse\n.\n\n\nAn abbreviated version of this table appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-U\n, \n--username\n\n\nPasses the user name to the server.\n\n\nWhen used with StoreFront, the site must be configured to support HTTP BasicAuth, otherwise these will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-P\n, \n--password\n\n\nPasses the password to the server.\n\n\nWhen used with StoreFront, the site must be configured to support HTTP BasicAuth, otherwise these will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-D\n, \n--domain\n\n\nPasses the domain to the server.\n\n\nWhen used with StoreFront, the site must be configured to support HTTP BasicAuth, otherwise these will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r\n, \n--icaroot\n\n\nSpecifies the root directory of the Receiver for Linux installation.\n\n\nIf not specified, the value is determined at run time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-i\n, \n--icons\n Use in conjunction with the \n-E\n, or \n-S\n option.\n\n\nFetches desktop or application icons, in PNG format, of the size and depth given by the \nbest\n or \nsize\n argument.\n If the \nbest\n argument is used, the best sized icon available on the server is fetched. You can convert this to any size required. The \nbest\n argument is the most efficient for storage and bandwidth, and can simplify scripting. \n If the \nsize\n argument is used, an icon is fetched of the specified size and depth. \n In both cases, icons are saved in a file for each of the resources that the \n\u2013E\n or \n-S\n option returns.\n\n\nThe \nbest\n argument creates an icon of the form \nresource name\n.png\n. \nThe \nsize\n argument is of the form \nWxB\n, where \nW\n is the width of the icon (all icons are square, so only one value is needed to specify the size), and \nB\n is the color depth (that is, the number of bits per pixel). \nW\n is required but \nB\n is optional. If it is not specified, icons of all available image depths are fetched for that size. The files that are created are named \nresource name\n_WxWxB.png\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-u\n, \n--unsubscribe\n\n\nUnsubscribes the specified resource from the given store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-s\n, \n--subscribe\n\n\nSubscribes the specified resource from the given store.\n\n\nIf you use a different Receiver, subscriptions on Program Neighborhood Agent servers are lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-W [r|R]\n, \n--reconnect [r|R]\n\n\nReconnects disconnected and active sessions.\n\n\nr\n reconnects all disconnected sessions for the user. \nR\n reconnects all active and disconnected sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-WD\n, \n--disconnect\n\n\nDisconnects all sessions.\n\n\nOnly affects sessions to the store specified on the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-WT\n, \n--logoff\n\n\nLogs off all sessions.\n\n\nOnly affects sessions to the store specified on the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-l\n, \n--liststores\n\n\nLists the known StoreFront stores, that is those that storebrowse can contact. These are the stores registered with the ServiceRecord proxy. Also lists Program Neighborhood sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-a\n, \n--addstore\n\n\nRegisters a new store, including its gateway and beacon details, with the Service Record daemon.\n\n\nReturns the full URL of the store. If this fails, an error is reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-g\n, \n--storegateway\n\n\nSets the default gateway for a store that is already registered with the Service Record daemon.\n\n\nThis command takes the following form: \n./util/storebrowse --storegateway \"\nunique gateway name\n\" '\nstore URL\n'\n \n \nImportant:\n The unique gateway name must be in the list of gateways for the specified store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-d\n, \n--deletestore\n\n\nDeregisters a store with the Service Record daemon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-c\n, \n--configselfservice\n\n\nGets and sets the self-service UI settings that are stored in StoreCache.ctx. Takes an argument of the form \nentry[=value]\n. If only entry is present, the setting's current value is printed. If a value is present, it is used to configure the setting.\n\n\nExample: \nstorebrowse --configselfservice SharedUserMode=True\n \n \nImportant:\n Both entry and value are case sensitive. Commands that use this option will fail if the case is different to the documented case of the setting itself (in StoreCache.ctx).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-C\n, \n--addCR\n\n\nReads the provided Citrix Receiver (CR) file, and prompts the user to add each store.\n\n\nThe output is the same as \n-a\n but might contain more than one store, separated by newlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-K\n, \n--killdaemon\n\n\nTerminates the storebrowse daemon process.\n\n\nAll credentials and tokens are purged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npnabrowse\n\n\n\n\nImportant\nThe \npnabrowse\n utility is deprecated but can still query Program Neighborhood Agent sites that run the Web Interface for lists of servers and published resources, and lets you connect to a published resource. Citrix discourages the use of \npnabrowse\n with StoreFront stores; use \nstorebrowse\n instead. \nstorebrowse\n can prompt for credentials from sites and stores. The \n-U\n, \n-P\n and \n-D\n options only work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn optional argument of pnabrowse specifies the server to connect to. This may be either: \n\n The name of the XenApp server, for options \n-S\n and \n-A\n. \n\n The URL of the server running Web Interface, for options \n-E\n and \n-L\n. \n\n\nThe \npnabrowse\n utility returns an exit value indicating success or failure, and can use the following options with XenApp: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-S\n\n\nList servers, one per line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-A\n\n\nList published applications, one per line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-m\n\n\nUsed in conjunction with \n-A\n, this expands the information returned about published applications to include Publisher, Video Type, Sound Type, AppInStartMenu, AppOnDesktop, AppIsDesktop, AppIsDisabled, Window Type, WindowScale, and Display Name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-M\n\n\nUsed in conjunction with \n-A\n, this selects individual columns of information returned about published applications. It takes an argument (1-1023) which is the sum of the numbers corresponding to the required details: Publisher(1), Video Type(2), Sound Type(4), AppInStartMenu(8), AppOnDesktop(16), AppIsDesktop(32), AppIsDisabled(64), Window Type(128), Window Scale(256), and DisplayName(512).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-c\n\n\nWhen appended to option \n-A\n, create files specifying the minimum information the client engine needs to connect to published applications; for example, application name, browse server, window resolution, color depth, audio, and encryption settings. File names are formatted as follows: \n/tmp/xxx_1.ica\n, \n/tmp/xxx_2.ica\n where \nxxx\n is replaced by the decimal process identifier for the pnabrowse process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-d\n\n\nUsed in conjunction with \n-L\n to specify the XDG desktop file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-e\n\n\nShows error numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-i\n\n\nInclude paths to files containing icon images for published applications in the output from option \n-A\n. Either .xpm or .png files are returned depending on the use of the size (WxB) option: \n \n \n-i\n returns 16x16 icons in XPM format at 4 bits per pixel \n \n-iWxB\n returns WxW icons in PNG format at B bits per pixel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-f\n\n\nInclude Citrix XenApp folder names for published applications in the output from option \n-A\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-u\n\n\nSpecify a user name for authenticating the user to a proxy server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-p\n\n\nSpecify a password for authenticating the user to a proxy server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following options provide Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Services functionality and can be used with both XenApp and XenDesktop functionality: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-D\n\n\nSpecify a domain for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-E\n\n\nInvoke Citrix XenApp and enumerate all published resources. \n If you specify both \n-E\n and \n-L\n, the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open. \n For each resource the following details are written to standard output, enclosed in single quotation marks and separated by tab characters: \n \nName:\n The display name from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box. \nFolder:\n The Program Neighborhood folder from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box. \nType:\n Either Application or Content. \nIcon:\n The full path name of an .xpm format icon file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-L\n\n\nSpecify the name of the published resource to which you want to connect. This invokes Citrix XenApp and launches a connection to a published resource. If you specify both -E and-L, the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-N\n\n\nSpecify a new password. This option must be used with existing credentials and is valid only when the existing password has expired, as indicated by the exit code 238: E_PASSWORD_EXPIRED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-P\n\n\nSpecify a password for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-U\n\n\nSpecify a user name for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-WD\n\n\nDisconnects all active sessions for the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-WT\n\n\nTerminates all sessions for the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Wr\n\n\nReconnects to all disconnected sessions for the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-WR\n\n\nReconnects to all sessions (active or disconnected) for the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-k\n\n\nUse an existing Kerberos ticket to authenticate, rather than user name, password, and domain. This requires configuration of the client and server. For more information, see the Using Kerberos with Citrix Receiver for Linux Guide. This is available from Citrix under a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following common options are used: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-q\n\n\nQuiet mode; do not print error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-r\n\n\nInclude raw icon data for published applications in the output from options \n-E\n or \n-A\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-V\n\n\nDisplays version details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-h\n\n\nPrint a usage message listing the options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-?\n\n\nPrint a usage message listing the options.",

Commands that use this option will fail if the case is different to the documented case of the setting itself (in StoreCache.ctx).    -C ,  --addCR  Reads the provided Citrix Receiver (CR) file, and prompts the user to add each store.  The output is the same as  -a  but might contain more than one store, separated by newlines.    -K ,  --killdaemon  Terminates the storebrowse daemon process.  All credentials and tokens are purged.",

            "text": "Important The  pnabrowse  utility is deprecated but can still query Program Neighborhood Agent sites that run the Web Interface for lists of servers and published resources, and lets you connect to a published resource. Citrix discourages the use of  pnabrowse  with StoreFront stores; use  storebrowse  instead.  storebrowse  can prompt for credentials from sites and stores. The  -U ,  -P  and  -D  options only work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites.     An optional argument of pnabrowse specifies the server to connect to. This may be either:   The name of the XenApp server, for options  -S  and  -A .   The URL of the server running Web Interface, for options  -E  and  -L .   The  pnabrowse  utility returns an exit value indicating success or failure, and can use the following options with XenApp:      Option  Description      -S  List servers, one per line.    -A  List published applications, one per line.    -m  Used in conjunction with  -A , this expands the information returned about published applications to include Publisher, Video Type, Sound Type, AppInStartMenu, AppOnDesktop, AppIsDesktop, AppIsDisabled, Window Type, WindowScale, and Display Name.    -M  Used in conjunction with  -A , this selects individual columns of information returned about published applications. It takes an argument (1-1023) which is the sum of the numbers corresponding to the required details: Publisher(1), Video Type(2), Sound Type(4), AppInStartMenu(8), AppOnDesktop(16), AppIsDesktop(32), AppIsDisabled(64), Window Type(128), Window Scale(256), and DisplayName(512).    -c  When appended to option  -A , create files specifying the minimum information the client engine needs to connect to published applications; for example, application name, browse server, window resolution, color depth, audio, and encryption settings. File names are formatted as follows:  /tmp/xxx_1.ica ,  /tmp/xxx_2.ica  where  xxx  is replaced by the decimal process identifier for the pnabrowse process.    -d  Used in conjunction with  -L  to specify the XDG desktop file.    -e  Shows error numbers.    -i  Include paths to files containing icon images for published applications in the output from option  -A . Either .xpm or .png files are returned depending on the use of the size (WxB) option:      -i  returns 16x16 icons in XPM format at 4 bits per pixel    -iWxB  returns WxW icons in PNG format at B bits per pixel    -f  Include Citrix XenApp folder names for published applications in the output from option  -A .    -u  Specify a user name for authenticating the user to a proxy server.    -p  Specify a password for authenticating the user to a proxy server.     The following options provide Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Services functionality and can be used with both XenApp and XenDesktop functionality:      Option  Description      -D  Specify a domain for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.    -E  Invoke Citrix XenApp and enumerate all published resources.   If you specify both  -E  and  -L , the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open.   For each resource the following details are written to standard output, enclosed in single quotation marks and separated by tab characters:    Name:  The display name from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box.  Folder:  The Program Neighborhood folder from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box.  Type:  Either Application or Content.  Icon:  The full path name of an .xpm format icon file.    -L  Specify the name of the published resource to which you want to connect. This invokes Citrix XenApp and launches a connection to a published resource. If you specify both -E and-L, the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open.    -N  Specify a new password. This option must be used with existing credentials and is valid only when the existing password has expired, as indicated by the exit code 238: E_PASSWORD_EXPIRED.    -P  Specify a password for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.    -U  Specify a user name for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service.    -WD  Disconnects all active sessions for the user.    -WT  Terminates all sessions for the user.    -Wr  Reconnects to all disconnected sessions for the user.    -WR  Reconnects to all sessions (active or disconnected) for the user.    -k  Use an existing Kerberos ticket to authenticate, rather than user name, password, and domain. This requires configuration of the client and server. For more information, see the Using Kerberos with Citrix Receiver for Linux Guide. This is available from Citrix under a non-disclosure agreement.     The following common options are used:      Option  Description      -q  Quiet mode; do not print error messages.    -r  Include raw icon data for published applications in the output from options  -E  or  -A .    -V  Displays version details.    -h  Print a usage message listing the options.    -?  Print a usage message listing the options.",
